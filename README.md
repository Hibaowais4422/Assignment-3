Python Data Types, Special Keywords, and Google Colab
Introduction
Welcome to this repository! This guide is for beginners and covers the basics of Python data types, special keywords, and an introduction to Google Colab. Understanding these concepts will help you get started with Python programming.

Python Data Types
In Python, data types define the kind of data that can be stored in a variable. Here are the most common data types in Python:

1. Numeric Types
int: Whole numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 100)
float: Numbers with decimals (e.g., 3.14, -5.6)
complex: Numbers with real and imaginary parts (e.g., 2+3j)
2. Sequence Types
list: A list is a collection of items (e.g., [1, 2, 3]). It can hold multiple items of different data types.
tuple: A tuple is like a list, but it cannot be changed (e.g., (1, 2, 3)).
range: Represents a range of numbers (e.g., range(5) creates numbers 0 to 4).
3. Text Type
str: A string is a sequence of characters (e.g., "Hello, world!").
4. Mapping Type
dict: A dictionary stores data in key-value pairs (e.g., {"name": "John", "age": 30}).
5. Set Types
set: A set is a collection of unique items (e.g., {1, 2, 3}). It doesn’t allow duplicate values.
frozenset: Like a set, but it cannot be changed after creation.
6. Boolean Type
bool: This represents either True or False.
7. Binary Types
bytes: A sequence of bytes (e.g., b"hello").
bytearray: A mutable sequence of bytes.
memoryview: A memory view object.
Python Special Keywords
In Python, keywords are reserved words that have special meanings. You cannot use them for naming variables or functions. Here’s a list of Python's most important keywords:

False, None, True
and, as, assert, break, class, continue, def
del, elif, else, except, finally, for, from
global, if, import, in, is, lambda, nonlocal
not, or, pass, raise, return, try, while, with, yield
These keywords help define the structure of Python programs.

What is Google Colab?
Google Colab (short for Colaboratory) is an online tool that allows you to write and run Python code using your browser, with no setup required. It’s perfect for beginners and data science tasks.

Features of Google Colab:
Free access to powerful hardware like GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) for running code faster.
Cloud-based: You don’t need to install anything. All your work is saved in Google Drive.
Supports Jupyter Notebooks: You can create interactive documents that include Python code, text, and visualizations.
